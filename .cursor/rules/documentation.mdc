# Documentation File Creation Rules

This rule governs when and how documentation files are created.

## Markdown File Creation Policy

**NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files.**

Only create documentation files when:

1. **Explicitly requested by the user**
   - User says "create a README"
   - User says "add documentation for X"
   - User says "write a guide for Y"

2. **Part of a specific deliverable**
   - User asks for a "complete package with documentation"
   - Documentation is a stated requirement

## Examples

### ❌ DO NOT CREATE

```
User: "Add branch protection rules"
AI: Creates both:
  - .cursor/rules/branch-protection.mdc ✅ (required for enforcement)
  - BRANCH-PROTECTION.md ❌ (not explicitly requested)
```

```
User: "Add pkg-config support"
AI: Creates:
  - nanopdf.pc.in ✅
  - mupdf.pc.in ✅
  - build.rs ✅
  - PKG-CONFIG.md ❌ (not explicitly requested)
```

```
User: "Implement feature X"
AI: Creates:
  - src/feature_x.rs ✅
  - FEATURE-X-GUIDE.md ❌ (not explicitly requested)
```

### ✅ DO CREATE

```
User: "Add branch protection and document how to set it up"
AI: Creates both:
  - .cursor/rules/branch-protection.mdc ✅
  - BRANCH-PROTECTION.md ✅ (explicitly requested)
```

```
User: "Create a README for the project"
AI: Creates:
  - README.md ✅ (explicitly requested)
```

```
User: "Document the pkg-config usage"
AI: Creates:
  - PKG-CONFIG.md ✅ (explicitly requested)
```

## Rationale

### Why This Rule Exists

1. **Reduces clutter** - Avoid filling the repository with unasked-for documentation
2. **User control** - Let the user decide what documentation they need
3. **Stay focused** - Complete the requested task without scope creep
4. **Less maintenance** - Fewer files to maintain and keep synchronized

### What Documentation IS Allowed

These types of files are always allowed (as they serve specific purposes):

1. **Code comments** - Always document code with `///` and `//!`
2. **Cursor rules** - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files for AI behavior
3. **Configuration files** - Like `.editorconfig`, `rustfmt.toml`, etc.
4. **Package metadata** - Like `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, etc.
5. **Required files** - Like `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` (if part of release process)

## When User Wants Documentation

If the user's intent is ambiguous, ask for clarification:

```
User: "Add branch protection"

AI: "I'll add the cursor rule for branch protection enforcement. 
     Would you also like me to create a setup guide document (BRANCH-PROTECTION.md)?"
```

## Exceptions

The only exceptions to this rule are:

1. **README.md** - If creating a brand new project/package from scratch
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - If explicitly part of the release workflow
3. **LICENSE** files - Required for legal compliance
4. **Contributing guidelines** - If creating a new open-source project

Even in these cases, prefer asking the user first if ambiguous.

## Summary

**Default behavior: Don't create .md files unless explicitly requested.**

When implementing a feature:
- ✅ Create code files
- ✅ Create configuration files
- ✅ Create cursor rules
- ✅ Add code comments
- ❌ Don't create documentation files (unless asked)

**If in doubt, ask the user before creating documentation.**
