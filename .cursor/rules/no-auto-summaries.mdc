# No Automatic Summary Documents

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create summary documents unless explicitly requested by the user.

## What NOT to Create Automatically

Never proactively create any of the following files without explicit user request:

### Documentation Files
- `*_SUMMARY.md`
- `*_REPORT.md`
- `*_OVERVIEW.md`
- `*_GUIDE.md`
- `CHANGELOG_*.md`
- `MIGRATION_*.md`
- `COMPLETION_*.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_*.md`
- `AUDIT_*.md`
- Any other markdown files documenting completed work

### Status/Report Files
- Progress reports
- Completion summaries
- Architecture summaries
- Feature implementation summaries
- Work session summaries
- Task completion reports

## Rationale

1. **User Control**: The user decides what documentation is needed
2. **No Clutter**: Avoid filling the repository with unnecessary files
3. **User's Responsibility**: Documentation strategy is the user's decision
4. **Ask First**: If documentation seems valuable, suggest it instead

## What IS Allowed Without Asking

- **Code comments**: Always document code with comments
- **Inline documentation**: Doc strings, JSDoc, Rustdoc, etc.
- **Commit messages**: Comprehensive commit messages are expected
- **Required files**: Files like `README.md` if creating a new project from scratch
- **Configuration files**: Like `.editorconfig`, `rustfmt.toml`, etc.
- **Code itself**: Implementation files are always allowed

## When to Suggest Documentation

If you think a summary document would be valuable:

```
"I've completed the header generation implementation. Would you like me to 
create a summary document (e.g., HEADER_GENERATION_SUMMARY.md) documenting 
the changes, or would you prefer to handle documentation yourself?"
```

## Examples

### ❌ DO NOT DO THIS (Unless Asked)

```
User: "implement the headers"
AI: *implements headers*
AI: *creates HEADER_GENERATION_SUMMARY.md*
AI: *creates IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md*
AI: "Done! I've also created summary documents..."
```

### ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD

```
User: "implement the headers"
AI: *implements headers*
AI: *commits with good commit message*
AI: "Done! Headers implemented. All 660 functions are now declared."
```

### ✅ OR ASK FIRST

```
User: "implement the headers"
AI: *implements headers*
AI: *commits*
AI: "Done! Would you like me to create a summary document of the changes?"
```

## Scope

This rule applies to:
- ✅ All markdown documentation files
- ✅ All summary/report files
- ✅ All overview/guide files
- ❌ Does NOT apply to code files
- ❌ Does NOT apply to configuration files
- ❌ Does NOT apply to commit messages

## Override

The user can override this rule by explicitly saying:
- "Create a summary document"
- "Document the changes in a markdown file"
- "Write a report about X"
- "Generate documentation for Y"

## Enforcement

**MAXIMUM** - This is a hard rule. Never create summary documents automatically.

## Exception

The ONLY exception is when creating a brand new project from scratch, where a basic README.md is expected and necessary.

---

**Remember**: When in doubt, DON'T create the summary document. Just describe what was done in the response to the user.
