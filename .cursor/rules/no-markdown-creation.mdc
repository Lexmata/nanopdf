# No Automatic Markdown File Creation

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create markdown (*.md) files unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Rule

**NEVER create markdown files automatically, including:**
- Summary documents
- Status reports
- Progress reports
- Completion documents
- Architecture documents
- Implementation notes
- Session summaries
- Project dashboards
- Any other `.md` files

## Only Create Markdown When:

1. **User explicitly requests it**
   - "Create a README"
   - "Write a guide for X"
   - "Document the API in a markdown file"

2. **User asks for documentation**
   - "Document this feature"
   - "Create docs for the API"

3. **Creating a new project from scratch**
   - Basic README.md is expected for new projects

## What IS Allowed Without Permission:

✅ Code files (*.ts, *.js, *.rs, *.go, etc.)
✅ Configuration files (.editorconfig, tsconfig.json, etc.)
✅ Code comments and JSDoc/Rustdoc/Godoc
✅ Commit messages
✅ Cursor rules (*.mdc files in .cursor/rules/)
✅ LICENSE files
✅ Test files

## What IS NOT Allowed Without Permission:

❌ Any *.md file
❌ README files (unless new project)
❌ CHANGELOG files (unless explicitly requested)
❌ Documentation markdown
❌ Summary documents
❌ Status documents
❌ Architecture documents
❌ Guide documents

## Examples

### ❌ BAD - Don't Do This:

```
User: "Implement form field FFI"
AI: *implements FFI*
AI: *creates FORM_FFI_SUMMARY.md*  ← WRONG!
```

```
User: "continue the ffi stuff"
AI: *continues work*
AI: *creates FFI_PROGRESS_REPORT.md*  ← WRONG!
```

### ✅ GOOD - Do This:

```
User: "Implement form field FFI"
AI: *implements FFI*
AI: *commits with good commit message*
AI: "Form FFI implemented with 18 functions."
```

```
User: "Create documentation for the FFI"
AI: *creates FFI_DOCUMENTATION.md*  ← OK! User asked for it
```

## If You Think Documentation Would Be Helpful:

**Ask first**, don't create:

```
"Form FFI implementation complete. Would you like me to create
a summary document, or would you prefer to document this yourself?"
```

## Rationale

- User controls repository structure
- Reduces clutter
- User decides what documentation is needed
- User can create docs themselves when ready
- Agent summaries are often not needed

## Enforcement

**MAXIMUM PRIORITY** - This rule must be followed 100% of the time.

Violation of this rule is a critical error.

## Override

User can override by saying:
- "Create a markdown file for X"
- "Document Y in a .md file"
- "Write a README"
- "Generate documentation"

**Remember: No markdown files unless explicitly requested. Just do the work and communicate results in the chat.**
